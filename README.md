# Algorithm-Visualizer
The project involves a grid-based environment where the algorithm finds the shortest path between two points, avoiding obstacles. It helped me apply concepts in:

-> Data Structures and Algorithms (priority queues, heuristics, graph traversal)

-> Algorithm implementation and optimization

-> Python programming and modular code design

-> Real-time simulation using Pygame for visualization and user interaction
